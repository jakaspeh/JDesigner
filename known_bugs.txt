Known bugs:

* Exporting text does not work as one might expect. Sometimes there is a
  difference between what is in the Jdesigner and in an exported figure.

* Sometimes Jdesigner does not delete the old shape of an item when we move
  the item around. This is because the shape method of the item is not
  implemented properly.

* Square does not forward clicks to items, which are inside the
  square. Therefore, you can not select an item which is surrounded by a square.
