Jdesigner is an XKCD designer for mathematicians. 

Examples
========

Here are two figures which were made with the help of Jdesigner. 

Jdesigner was originally build for making diagrams:

But you can also create different figures:

Features
========

You can interactivelly construct a figure and then export it to a file
(typicaly to a png or a pdf file). You can also "XKCD"-fy your figure.

You can save your current work to a .jdes file and then load this file
later. See examples of *.jdes files in the folder [examples](examples/)

You can build your figure with a set of primitives:
* Bezier curves,
* polylines,
* squares,
* and texts.

The primitives can be combined together to a composition, see Load Composition
option in the main menu.
